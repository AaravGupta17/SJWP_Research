MAIN WORK - GET DATA FROM MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE GLOBE



Phase 0: Problem Quantification (The "How Big" Phase)
[ ] Data Mining (National): Extract specific NRW (Non-Revenue Water) stats from the NITI Aayog CWMI Report.

[ ] Local Context: Find water loss percentages specifically for Noida/Delhi/NCR to make the project "Indigenous."

[ ] Economic Analysis: Calculate (or find) the cost of treated water per kiloliter to estimate the monetary loss of a 40% leak rate.

[ ] The "Failure" Case Study: Document why traditional acoustic sensors fail specifically in Indian urban density (noise floor levels in dB).


Phase 1: Conceptual Foundation (The "Logic" Phase)
[ ] Finalize the Problem Statement: Combine the "How Big" stats into a compelling 2-page Introduction.

[ ] Literature Review: Find 3–5 papers on Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI).

[ ] Define Variables: Select the parameters for the 96 simulations.

[ ] Design the Matrix: Create the Excel sheet of variable combinations.

Phase 2: Synthetic Data Generation (The "Engineering" Phase)
[ ] Base Model: Create the 3D pipe model in Ansys/COMSOL.

[ ] Validation: Run the "Baseline" (No-Leak) simulation.

[ ] Batch Processing: Run the simulations.

[ ] Data Export: Move CSVs to data/raw/.

Phase 3: AI Development (The "Intelligence" Phase)
[ ] Signal Processing: Write the FFT/Wavelet transform scripts.

[ ] Noise Injection: Add urban ambient noise to the datasets.

Phase 4: Final Submission
[ ] Write the 20-page Paper.

[ ] Prepare the SJWP Presentation/Poster.

[ ] Model Training: Train the CNN/Architecture.

[ ] Evaluation: Generate accuracy reports.
